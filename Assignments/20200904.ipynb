    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an\n",
    "integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this\n",
    "process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following\n",
    "sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:\n",
    "\n",
    "22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 for\n",
    "every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1, 000, 000.\n",
    "For an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and\n",
    "including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two\n",
    "numbers i and j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers\n",
    "between i and j, including both endpoints.\n",
    "Input\n",
    "The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers per\n",
    "line. All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater than 0.\n",
    "Output\n",
    "For each pair of input integers i and j, output i, j in the same order in which they\n",
    "appeared in the input and then the maximum cycle length for integers between and\n",
    "including i and j. These three numbers should be separated by one space, with all three\n",
    "numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input.\n",
